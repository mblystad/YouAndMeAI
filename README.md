# 🎮 You and Me 🌅  
*A very, very simple Pygame platformer – 100% AI-generated*  

## About the Project  
**You and Me** is a **proof of concept**, not a polished game. It’s a **very simple** platformer built with **Pygame**, created entirely through AI generation. The goal was never to make something "enjoyable" as a game, but rather to experiment with AI-assisted game development and see how far prompting alone could take the project.  

### Features (if you can call them that):  
- Basic platformer mechanics (walk, jump, reach the end of the level)  
- A gradient sky with a moving sun ☀️  
- Fireworks when you complete a level 🎆  

## AI-Generated Project 🤖  
This project is **100% AI-generated** – I have only:  
✅ Provided prompts  
✅ Tested functionality  
✅ Edited the PNG assets (which were also AI-generated)  

Everything else, including logic, structure, and mechanics, was created by AI.  

## How to Play  
- Use **arrow keys** to move
- Use **space** do jump if you need to cross tall grass (green block)
- Walk to the right until you reach the end  
- Fireworks will go off 🎇  
- That’s it. Really.  

## Installation & Running the Game  
If, for some reason, you want to try it out:  

```bash
pip install pygame pygame-freetype
python main.py

Why?
This isn’t meant to be a "real" game, but rather a fun experiment in AI-generated code. It’s a small way to explore how AI can assist in game development with minimal human input. If you want to fork it, break it, or expand on it – go for it! 🚀
